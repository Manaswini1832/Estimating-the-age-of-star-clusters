**We worked with the SDSS database and and compiled the SQL search results for different star clusters to come up with a CMD and did
isochrone fitting for it.u vs u-g, g vs g-r and r vs r-i. Then we got the distance modulus
Learnt about plotting with python using Pandas and Matplotlib
I worked with the following clusters
M5(13.5Gyr), M92(10 Gyr), M15(12Gyr), M67(4Gyr)

**We started working on the M35 cluster too, but this time, by manually collecting data points using DS9. I took up the
task of data collection from Column 3


**Learnt :
	Jupyter notebook usage
	DS9
	Matplotlib to plot data pounts
	Used the Pandas library to read files into a Pythn program
	Working with a CSV file
	
**Tools used :
	SDSS database
	Dartmouth Isochrone generator
