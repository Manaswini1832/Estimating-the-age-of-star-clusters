Temperature & u-v relation(logarithmic relation)
u-->Luminosity
u-g----->Temp
Take spectras&ugriz values from SDSS
Work on obtaininig temp from spectras
Search for objects with red square and blue circle i.e. search for stars 
with spectra&photometric object(We are looking only for stars and not
galaxies)
Click on spectra-->interactive spectrum option---->Download the fits
file

Even one star is enough!!

Manually enter temperature in the csv file(Read code-->shared on group)
Take data from link on group(pm &spectral obj stars find, add to notes, click on show notes),
--->download csv file&interactive spectrum, for every star run the code for temp
--->make separate col of temp and write the temp there,
 fit into black body curve,
 obtain temp(all this
from code) and then enter in csv file, share on group

Update dropbox paper

M15 Star1 : http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr9/en/tools/chart/book.asp

**In case you don't understand what we are doing in the project, go through
the research paper mentioned in the group
**Read about least square fitting as well
**Data reduction and error analysis for Physical Sciences
**SKLN library thing we used(Check this properly)


**Next 30 days do this thing for atleast 10-15 stars
